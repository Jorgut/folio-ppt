# Folio · Design Intelligence Engine

> Magazine-style presentation engine. Structured content → template-driven layout → multi-format export.

```text
You describe what you need → Folio determines style & structure → renders & exports → you get the deliverable
```

Single source, multiple outputs: **HTML Slides / PPTX / PDF / Figma**. No manual layout work.

---

## Quick Start

Open Claude (or any AI with this Skill loaded) and say:

> **"Use Folio to make a presentation about [your topic], export as HTML."**

The AI will walk through:
1. **Content** — How many slides? What goes on each page? Any images?
2. **Style** — Pick from 10 visual styles, or describe the feeling for a recommendation
3. **Output** — HTML / PPTX / PDF / Figma

That's it. You get your deck.

|----------|------------|---------|
| Portfolio / Project review | ✅ Magazine-grade layout, no design skills needed | |
| Product launch / Pitch deck | ✅ Fast turnaround, consistent quality | |
| Academic presentation | ✅ Clean, professional, PDF-ready | |
| Figma design → presentation | ✅ C2D high-fidelity import | |
| Content that changes often | ✅ Edit content without touching layout | |
| Highly custom animations | | ❌ Not a frontend framework |
| 50+ page documents | | ❌ Optimized for 6-20 slides |

## FAQ

### Do I need to know how to code?

No. Just tell the AI what you want. Templates, rendering, and export are automatic.

| HTML | Yes — edit text and images directly |
| PPTX | Yes — any text in PowerPoint / Keynote |
| PDF Print | No (print-ready), but re-export anytime |
| Figma | Yes — all text and images in Frames |

### What doesn't Folio do?

- Not for 50+ page documents (optimized for 6-20 slides)
